            <sup>1</sup>Earlier examples, such as the one <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US746971A/en" target="_blank">patented</a> in New York, were actually "cups."</a>
             The first ice cream "cone" was sold at the World's Fair, as the above photo illustrates.
        <br><sup>2</sup>Originally called "Fairy Floss," it was invented by a St. Louis dentist!
        <br><sup>3</sup>Dubbed a "fruit icicle," it functioned like a push-pop in a tin tube (warmed by one's hand). It debuted several years before the Popsicle brand.
        <br><sup>4</sup>Sold as candy, long before anyone snapped, crackled, or popped.
        <br><sup>5</sup>It did not catch on originally. Perhaps choices like banana-and prune flavored coffee were too ahead of it's time.
